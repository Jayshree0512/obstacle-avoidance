# obstacle-avoidance

If the car finds any obstacle it changes the direction and continue moving with the help of Ultrasonic Sensor that can be used to Avoid Obstacles.
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is used.

As the name indicates, ultrasonic / level sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic waves.
The sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the wave reflected back from the target. ultrasonic / level sensors measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception.
